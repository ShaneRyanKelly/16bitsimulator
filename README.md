my_sim is a program which simulates the functioning of a 
simple 16-bit system at the assembly level. my_sim takes 
in a binary machine code file as input and parses that
file translating the binary and performing the operations
relative to the parsed binary file.

This program was completed for a class in Assembly Language
and Computer Architecture at the State University of New 
York at New Paltz. The test input file testsprog.mac is
included for testing.
